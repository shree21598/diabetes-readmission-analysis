# Diabetes Readmission Analysis

This repository contains the code and data for analyzing the factors causing readmission of diabetic patients. The dataset used is collected from various US hospitals and focuses on understanding the factors influencing diabetic patients' readmission rates.

# Dataset

You can download the dataset from the following link:(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Diabetes+130-US+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008)

The dataset consists of 101,766 instances and includes 50 variables encompassing demographic information, laboratory test results, pharmaceutical data, and other hospital admission-related details. The variables capture patient demographics such as age, gender, and race, primary and secondary diagnoses, test results like HbA1c levels, medications prescribed (e.g., insulin, metformin), and various clinical and hospital-related factors.

# Purpose

The main purpose of this analysis is to identify the factors that contribute to readmission of diabetic patients. The dataset enables researchers to study the correlation between different variables and readmission rates, allowing for the development of prediction models and interventions to reduce readmission risks.
